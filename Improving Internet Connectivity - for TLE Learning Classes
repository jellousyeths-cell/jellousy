The Problem
Many students experience poor internet connection during online TLE classes. Slow speeds and frequent disconnections make it difficult to complete activities and access online tools.
This issue affects learning performance, participation, and overall classroom productivity.
Effects include:

Proposed Solution
To solve the issue of poor internet connection during TLE classes, we propose setting up a separate router dedicated only to TLE use.
This reduces network traffic and allows smoother access to online TLE tools and platforms.
Benefits include:
Improves internet speed during TLE classes
Reduces disconnections and lag
Ensures stable access to online resources
Allows better monitoring of TLE network usage
The success of this solution can be measured by fewer disconnections and more efficient completion of online TLE activities.
